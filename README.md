# hello-world
my data science community intro
I'm re-entering the workforce as a senior data analyst after an 18-month layoff, and would like to create some projects to add to my portofolio to enhance my job opportunities. I'm well versed and certified in the SAS programming language, but a beginner when it comes to R and Python. I'm always excited about learning something new, even if the challenge is difficult.
